# Sensemaker Starter kit
Documentation and source for the Sensemaker Kit

The basic kit consists of the following components:
- Wemos D1 mini
- Button shield
- DHT shield
- RGB Led shield
- Breadboard with 400 holes
- Set of 10 jumper cables

In the underlying directories, the Wemos D1 mini board itself and the shields are described. With every board there is a basic script example that you can use to make your first steps with the board and shields. Later on, we will add other and more advanced/complex scripts.

* The scripts come from the Wemos github repository, which you can find over here: [https://github.com/wemos/D1_mini_Examples](https://github.com/wemos/D1_mini_Examples). We will maintain our own repository with examples over here.

* There is also a very comprehensive book on the ESP8266 itself (the 'heart' of the Wemos D1 Mini). It is free to download, and if you wish, you can give a donation to the author. You can find it over here: [http://neilkolban.com/tech/esp8266/](http://neilkolban.com/tech/esp8266/)

* For getting started in programming in the Arduino IDE, this is a useful guide to get you on the way: [http://playground.arduino.cc/uploads/Main/arduino_notebook_v1-1.pdf](http://playground.arduino.cc/uploads/Main/arduino_notebook_v1-1.pdf)
